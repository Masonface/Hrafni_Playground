# Hrafni_Playground
A test Unity project to test 3D models for DFU, outside the DFU framework until we can get them implemented. This will serve as a sterile test environment for now so we don't have to rely on Asset Injection in order to see what the 3D models will look like inside Unity compared to its vanilla asset counterparts.

This project also contains SpriteWrite, which renders the 3D model as a dynamic "fake sprite" impostor.  It uses orthographic projection and can reduce the resolution and color depth so you can compare the new model to the sprite on a closer to 1-to-1 basis to check parity.

The settings above "UMA Character" are stable and I encourage you to mess around with them.

The settings below "Self Shadowing" are experiemental and is best to be left alone for now.
