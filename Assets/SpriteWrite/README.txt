# SpriteWrite
 Real time, dynamic sprite imposter system for Unity 3D game engine.

 ***This is a trial demonstration only! Not for commercial use!***

 Installation instructions:

 1) Import the SpriteWrite package into Unity.

 Usage instructions:

1) Place a Sprite Write Manager into your scene:
	a) From the top menu, select "GameObject/Effects/Add Sprite Write Manager"
	Note) You only need one instance of this in your scene!

2) Add the SpriteWrite effect to a GameObject:
	a) Select a GameObject in your scene.
	b) Right click the GameObject in your Hierarch tab, then select "Effects/Add Sprite Write" 

If successful, it will have added all the needed scripts and prefabs for the effect and moved your 
3D models into the "3D Model" layer.

3) Adjust the SpriteOrigin and BasePlane child objects (if necessary):
	a) If the character's transform isn't setup right, you may need to account for that.
	b) If the BasePlane and SpriteOrigin objects aren't at the character's feet, then
		adjust their Y transforms until they are just beneath them.

4) Configure SpriteWrite:
	a) Select the GameObject that you added the SpriteWrite effect to.
	b) You should see the SpriteWrite script in the inspector.
	c) Modify the Quality Settings to your liking.

5) Have fun!
	a) That's all! Hit play and see it in action.
